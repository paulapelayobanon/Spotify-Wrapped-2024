# Spotify-Wrapped-2024
Like many people, I was suspicious about the output of my Spotify Wrapped in early December 2024, so I decided to take matters into my own hands and get insights myself from my raw data using R.

I am by no means a developer and I was just curious whether Spotify was right or not regarding my top artists and songs (spoiler alert: it was wrong, at least partly).

I got the data from my own Spotify profile. You can request it from Spotify directly from the settings. It takes a few days until you receive an email with the raw data in a .json file.

My R analysis is very basic and should only provide a few insights. I'm pretty sure you guys can dig ten times deeper and find gold mines - feel free to do so, I'm just glad that my code worked for once :D
